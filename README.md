## Note
The PyQt folder contains a Qt GUI that we originally wanted to use for this project. However, due to design limitations of the library, we have decided to use a Flask Application with python, HTML, CSS and Javascript for the user interface.

The old Qt GUI can be viewed by navigating to the PyQt folder by using `cd PyQt` and then running it using `python<version> app.py`. Example: `python3 app.py`.
